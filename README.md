# Tokenized-contract

This Solidity smart contract implements a framework for creating and managing tokenized bonds on the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates the issuance, trading, and redemption of bonds in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner. Each bond series is represented as a unique ERC-6909 token, providing users with fractional ownership of traditional bonds.
